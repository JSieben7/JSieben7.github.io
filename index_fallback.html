	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Jennifer Sieben is a current graduate student at Indiana University pursuing a PhD in Astronomy. Her current interests are large scale structure, cosmology, star formation rate over cosmic time, and gravitational waves. She wishes there were more hours in a day to allow her to study all of these topics.<br>
	When not been buried under homework or research work, she can be found writing novels and short stories, editing videos for youtube, or curled up with a cup of earl grey and a good book.</p>

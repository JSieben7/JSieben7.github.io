      Survey with WIYN telescope with the goal of tracing evolution of star forming galaxies over cosmic times.
      </p>
	<p>
	We use narrow-band and broad-band images to identify possible emission-line galaxy candidates based on an excess of narrow-band flux. These objects are later confirmed with follow-up spectroscopy. Due to the depth of our survey, we are looking deeper than SDSS and, because we are selecting galaxies via emission lines, we detect objects not found in a more traditional broadband survey.

      Observations of Delta Scuti stars with small telescope to determine rotation periods.
      </p>
	<p>
	This study was carried out using the Mark Evans Observatory on campus. One complete lightcurve was observed and it was found to match to values in the literature.

      Observations of Trojan asteroids with the Cerro Tololo 0.9m telescope to determine rotation periods in order to discover a spin barrier and a limit of the density for comparison with cometary nuclei.
      </p>
	<p>
	Multiple Trojan asteroids were observed in this continuing project to study the composition of asteroids. By more closely understanding the rotation periods of these asteroids, we further constrain models of the formation of our solar system.
